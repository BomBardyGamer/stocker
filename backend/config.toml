# Where Stocker should bind the web interface at.
#
# The hostname and port provided here will be bound to by actix, and so
# must be free and available for actix to use. This is also where the
# web interface and REST API will be found.
[web]
# The host name or IP address the web server should bind to.
# Use "0.0.0.0" for all interfaces. Defaults to "127.0.0.1".
hostname = "127.0.0.1"
# The port the web server should bind to. Defaults to 8080.
port = 8080

# Where Stocker should find your database and how it will connect to it.
#
# The details provided here will be formatted in to a PostgreSQL connection
# string, as defined here:
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING
#
# For example, the default string will be as follows:
# postgres://stocker:stocker@localhost:5432/stocker
[database]
# The host name or IP address where the database is located. Defaults to "localhost".
# If this begins with a slash ('/'), it denotes a UNIX domain socket.
hostname = "localhost"
# The port that the database is bound to. Defaults to 5432.
#port = "5432"
# The name of the database. Defaults to "stocker".
name = "stocker"
# The username to connect to the database with. Defaults to "stocker".
username = "stocker"
# The password to connect to the database with. Defaults to "stocker".
password = "stocker"
# The SSL mode for database connections.
#
# The options here are as follows:
# * "disable" - Disables SSL entirely.
# * "allow" - Allows SSL connections, but does not require them.
# * "prefer" - Prefers SSL connections where possible, but some connections may still be non-SSL.
# * "require" - Requires that all connections be encrypted with SSL. This is the default.
# * "verify-ca" - Same as require but also verifies the authority of connections.
# * "verify-all" - Same as verify-ca, but also verifies the host name matches that in the certificate.
# More information can be found here:
# https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-SSLMODE-STATEMENTS
ssl-mode = "require"
# The name of the file containing the SSL root certificate.
# This is used when the SSL mode is "verify-ca" or "verify-full".
#ssl-root-certificate = "./ca-certificate.crt"

# How Stocker's database connection pool should be set up.
# This is for advanced users. Don't touch these if you don't know what they mean.
[database.pool]
# The maximum number of connections that may be in the pool. Defaults to 10.
max-size = 10
# The minimum number of idle connections the pool will maintain. Defaults to max-size.
#min-idle = 10
# The maximum amount of time a connection can be open for, in seconds. Defaults to 30 minutes (1800 seconds).
max-lifetime = 1800
# The amount of time after which idle connections will be closed, in seconds. Defaults to 10 minutes (600 seconds).
idle-timeout = 600
# The amount of time Stocker will wait for a connection before timing out, in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
connection-timeout = 30
